## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site
- Receive an error message when the contact form is submitted if:
- The `Name`, `Email Address` or `Message` fields are empty should show "This field can't be empty"
- The `Email Address` is not formatted correctly should show "Please use a valid email address"

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com) - React framework
- [Sanity](https://www.sanity.io) - CMS
- [Graphql](https://graphql.org) - Query language
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles
- [react-reveal](https://www.react-reveal.com) - For animation
- [Formik](https://formik.org) - For formulary
- [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/teams/alfre-canos13/overview) - Deployment


### What I learned

I learnt to pull out data from a CMS (Sanity) with a query language (Graphql) to display it in the frontend (Gatsby)

### Continued development

I would like to clean the code to improve its performance.

### Useful resources

- [Egghead](https://egghead.io/courses/create-forms-in-react-applications-with-react-final-form-2bcd34cb) - This helped me to write the formulary pretty quick.
