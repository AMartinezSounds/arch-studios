## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site
- Receive an error message when the contact form is submitted if:
- The `Name`, `Email Address` or `Message` fields are empty should show "This field can't be empty"
- The `Email Address` is not formatted correctly should show "Please use a valid email address"

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com) - For styles
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) - For icons
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) - Deployment


### What I learned

Super interesting project that help me to understand all the basics about React working with hooks. 
I also learnt about the importance of state management libraries like Redux. Because I managed all the state by passing down props from the top component, and when you have so many props, this method becomes a nightmare.  

### Continued development

I would like to refactor the code to use a state management library.

### Useful resources

- [Egghead](https://egghead.io/courses/create-forms-in-react-applications-with-react-final-form-2bcd34cb) - This helped me to write the formulary pretty quick.
